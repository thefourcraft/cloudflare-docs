```js
const html = `<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>This markup was generated by a Cloudflare Worker.</p>
</body>`;

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response(html, {
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'text/html;charset=UTF-8',
    },
  });
}

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  return event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});
```
The worker defines an `html` variable that contains the HTML content to be returned, and an `async` function named `handleRequest()` that returns a Response object with the HTML content and the appropriate `content-type` header.

The worker also uses the `addEventListener()` method to attach an event listener for the `fetch` event.\
This event listener calls the `handleRequest()` function and uses the `respondWith()` method to return the response to the client.

This worker is a very basic example, but it shows how a Cloudflare Worker can be used to handle HTTP requests and return custom responses.\
In a more complex scenario, the worker could perform additional tasks, such as modifying the request or response, fetching data from an external API, or implementing custom logic.
